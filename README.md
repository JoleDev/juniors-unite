This project has; React, React-Router and Bootstrap. What we want to do is just play with this app! But i think maybe you create a component in the components folder, then create it's link in the navbar and show it.
<h1>How to create a new component?</h1>
<b>When you open the project with your editor, you will find step 1 & 3 commented just follow.</b>

1- Define your components Route by naming it. go to App.js inside the div create a new line:<br/>
<Route path="/YOURCOMPONENT/" component={YOURCOMPONENT} />    like this <br/>
2- Create your component under src/components/YOURCOMPONENT.JSX<br/>
3- Import it to App.js<br/>
4- Now when you click to your component link navbar will stay the same, and main page is going to load your component(thanks to react-router).<br/>
5- Here on you can create any component as you wish; an egg timer, a simple music player, a random photo app, anything you desire or found fun/useful.<br/>
6- (Optional) If you want to apply custom CSS create a css file under /src/styles/YOURCOMPONENT.css<br/>
